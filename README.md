# Dearangements

## i
Simulate 100 flips of a fair coin, and calculate the length of the longest run. (A run is a set of consecutive flips with the same outcomes. For example, the longest run for the sequence HTTHTTTTHT has length four. Before starting the programming part of this exercise, try writing down a random looking string of H’s and T’s of length 100, and then determine the length of the longest run.). Simulate this experiment (using 100 flips per experiment) 10,000 times, and then make a histogram of the 10,000 values of the longest runs

## ii 
Develop an algorithm that computes the probability of a derangement in a collection of N items. Implement the algorithm an appropriate programming language. Probe whether the number of derangements follow any recurrence relation. Hence, use the recurrence relation to generate a sequence of derangements. What can be said about probability of derangements?

## iii
Can you think about any practical applications of the experiments above (i.e., i and ii)?
