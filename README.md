## ii 
Develop an algorithm that computes the probability of a derangement in a collection of N items. Implement the algorithm an appropriate programming language. Probe whether the number of derangements follow any recurrence relation. Hence, use the recurrence relation to generate a sequence of derangements. What can be said about probability of derangements?

## iii
Can you think about any practical applications of the experiments above (i.e., i and ii)?
