# Derangements

## Part I: Derangements
In this part, I try to develop an algorithm that computes the probability of a derangement in a collection of N-items and then implement the algorithm in python3. 
I also derive the recurrance relation for the number of derangements and use the same to generate a sequence of derangements. I also briefly look into the convergence of the probability of derangment for a large collection of objects.

## Part II: Matrices and Markov Chains
I have used python3 to generate stochastic matrixes and check for their regularity upto any given upper bound.
