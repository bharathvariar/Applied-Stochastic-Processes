# Derangements

Project for the course MATH F424: Applied Stochastic Processes

In this project, I try to develop an algorithm that computes the probability of a derangement in a collection of N-items and then implement the algorithm in python3. 
I also derive the recurrance relation for the number of derangements and use the same to generate a sequence of derangements. I also briefly look into the convergence of the probability of derangment for a large collection of objects.
